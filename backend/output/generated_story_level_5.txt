**Rapunzel**

Once there was a man and a woman who wanted very much to have a baby. After a long time, the woman thought that her wish might come true. They had a little window in their house where they could see a beautiful garden. The garden had the most lovely flowers and herbs. But it was surrounded by a tall wall, and no one dared go in because it belonged to a powerful enchantress.

One day, the woman looked into the garden and saw some fresh green rampion (also known as rapunzel). She wanted to eat it so much that she felt sick. Her husband saw her looking sad and asked, “What is wrong, dear wife?” She said, “If I can’t eat some of that rampion from the garden, I will die!”

The man loved her very much, so he decided to help her. That evening, he climbed over the wall and took some rampion from the garden. He brought it home, and his wife made a salad with it. It was so delicious that she wanted more the next day. 

Her husband had to go back to the garden. When he was there again, he was frightened because the enchantress saw him! “How dare you steal my rampion?” she shouted angrily. “You will pay for this!” 

He said, “Please have mercy! I took it because my wife is sick and she longs for it.” The enchantress felt sorry for him and said, “I will let you take rampion, but you must give me the child that your wife will have. I will take care of it like a mother.”

The man was scared but agreed. When their baby was born, the enchantress took the child and named her Rapunzel.

As Rapunzel grew up, she became the most beautiful girl in the world. When she turned twelve, the enchantress locked her in a tower in a forest. The tower had no stairs or door, just a little window at the top. When the enchantress wanted to visit, she would call:

“Rapunzel, Rapunzel,  
Let down your hair to me.” 

Rapunzel had long, golden hair. When she heard the enchantress, she let her hair down so the enchantress could climb up.

One day, a prince rode through the forest and heard Rapunzel singing. He stopped to listen. The prince wanted to meet her, but he could not find a way into the tower. He went home but returned every day to hear her song.

One evening, he saw the enchantress come to the tower and heard her call for Rapunzel. “If that is how she gets in,” he thought, “I will try too!” 

The next night, he called:

“Rapunzel, Rapunzel,  
Let down your hair to me.” 

Rapunzel let down her hair, and the prince climbed up. At first, she was scared to see him, but he spoke kindly. He told her how he had been enchanted by her voice. Soon, they were friends.

The prince asked Rapunzel to marry him. “I will go with you,” she said. “But I don’t know how to get down! Bring a piece of silk every time you come, and I will make a ladder.”

The prince agreed to visit her every evening. The enchantress did not notice what was happening until one day Rapunzel asked her, “Why are you so heavy to pull up, but the prince is so light?”

The enchantress became furious! She cut off Rapunzel’s beautiful hair and took her far away to a lonely place.

When the prince came to the tower and called for Rapunzel, the enchantress let down the hair. He climbed up, but instead of his beloved Rapunzel, he found the enchantress who laughed at him. “The beautiful bird is gone! You will never see her again!” 

The prince was heartbroken. He jumped down from the tower but fell into thorny bushes that hurt his eyes. Blind and sad, he wandered through the forest for many years, missing Rapunzel.

One day, he heard a familiar voice singing. It was Rapunzel! He followed the sound until he found her. They hugged, and her tears touched his eyes, making them see again.

The prince took Rapunzel to his kingdom, where they were welcomed with joy. They lived happily ever after, side by side, with love in their hearts.
