**Rapunzel: A Level 8 Reader**

Once there was a man and a woman who longed for a child. They wished and wished, hoping that one day their dreams would come true. In their home, there was a small window that looked out at a beautiful garden filled with colorful flowers and fresh herbs. But the garden was surrounded by a high wall. No one was brave enough to go in, for it belonged to an enchantress who was very powerful and feared by all.

One day, the woman gazed into the garden and spotted a patch of lovely rampion (often called rapunzel). It looked so fresh and inviting that she wanted to eat it. She felt weak and sad because she could not have it. Concerned, her husband asked, “What is wrong, my dear?” She replied, “If I can’t eat some of that rampion from the garden, I think I will die!” 

Her husband loved her deeply. He decided, “I will get the rampion for you, no matter the cost.” As night fell, he climbed over the wall into the enchantress’ garden. He quickly grabbed a handful of rampion to take home. His wife made a salad from it and ate it eagerly. It was so delicious that the next day, her craving grew even stronger. Her husband had to go back again.

That evening, he climbed down into the garden once more. But he was scared because the enchantress appeared before him! “How dare you steal from my garden!” she said angrily. “You shall pay for this!” He explained, “Please have mercy! My wife is very sick for the rampion. She would die without it.” The enchantress softened a bit and said, “If you promise to give me the child your wife will one day have, I will let you take as much rampion as you want. I will care for it well.” In his fear, he agreed, and when his wife had a baby, the enchantress took the girl and named her Rapunzel.

Rapunzel grew into a beautiful girl. When she turned twelve, the enchantress locked her in a tower deep in the forest. The tower had no doors, only a small window at the very top. When the enchantress wanted to see Rapunzel, she would stand below the window and call out:

“Rapunzel, Rapunzel,  
Let down your hair to me.”

Rapunzel had long, golden hair. When she heard the enchantress’ voice, she would let down her hair, and the enchantress climbed up.

One day, a prince rode through the forest and heard a lovely song. He stopped and listened. It was Rapunzel, singing sweetly. He wanted to reach her but couldn’t find a way up the tower. After several days of returning to hear her song, he saw the enchantress come to the tower. He heard her call:

“Rapunzel, Rapunzel,  
Let down your hair to me.”

Rapunzel let down her hair, and the enchantress climbed up. The prince thought, “If that is how she gets in, I will try too!” That night, he called out:

“Rapunzel, Rapunzel,  
Let down your hair to me.”

Rapunzel was startled to see the prince, but he spoke to her kindly. He told her that her song had touched his heart. They talked and laughed, and soon Rapunzel felt brave. When he asked her to marry him, she happily agreed, thinking, “He will love me more than the old enchantress does.” She said, “I will go with you, but I do not know how to climb down. Bring a piece of silk each time you visit, and I will weave it into a ladder so I can escape with you.” 

They decided he would come to her every night because the enchantress visited during the day. The enchantress noticed something was different when Rapunzel said, “Dame Gothel, why is it that you are so heavy for me to pull up but the prince is not?” Furious, the enchantress screamed, “You wicked child! You have deceived me!” 

In her fury, she cut off Rapunzel's beautiful hair and took her far away to live in a lonely desert. The next day, when the prince arrived and cried out for Rapunzel, the enchantress let her hair down from the tower. He climbed up, but instead of finding Rapunzel, he faced the enchantress who laughed at him cruelly. 

“Your dear one is gone! She is lost forever!” Heartbroken, the prince jumped from the tower, hoping to escape. But he fell into thorn bushes, which blinded him. He wandered the forest for years, living in misery and surviving on roots and berries while weeping for his lost love.

Finally, he made his way to the desert where Rapunzel lived with her twin children. He heard a familiar voice, and as he approached, Rapunzel recognized him. They embraced, and two of her tears fell on his eyes, restoring his sight! 

Together, they returned to his kingdom where he was welcomed with joy. Rapunzel and the prince lived happily ever after, united at last.
