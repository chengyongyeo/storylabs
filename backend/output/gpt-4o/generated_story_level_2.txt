There once was a man and a woman who wanted a child. They lived near a garden full of flowers and tasty plants. But the garden belonged to a witch, and no one was allowed inside.

One day, the woman saw a plant called rampion in the garden. “I want to eat that rampion,” she said. “If I don’t, I will get sick.” Her husband loved her very much. He climbed over the wall, picked the rampion, and brought it to her.

The next day, she wanted more. So, he went back. But this time, the witch caught him. “How dare you steal from my garden!” she said.

“I am sorry,” the man said. “My wife needed the rampion, or she would have been very sick.”

The witch thought for a moment. “You may take the rampion, but I want your child when it is born,” she said. The man was scared and agreed.

When the baby was born, the witch took her away. She named her Rapunzel. Rapunzel grew into a kind and beautiful girl.

When Rapunzel turned 12, the witch locked her in a tall tower. The tower had no door, only a small window. The witch would stand at the bottom and call:

“Rapunzel, Rapunzel,
Let down your hair to me.”

Rapunzel’s long, golden hair would fall from the window, and the witch would climb up.

One day, a prince rode by the tower. He heard Rapunzel singing and wanted to see her. He waited and saw the witch climb up her hair. When the witch left, he called out:

“Rapunzel, Rapunzel,
Let down your hair to me.”

Rapunzel let her hair down, and the prince climbed up. At first, Rapunzel was scared, but the prince was kind. He asked her to marry him, and she said yes. They made a plan to escape.

But one day, Rapunzel told the witch about the prince. The witch was very angry. She cut off Rapunzel’s hair and sent her far away.

The prince came to the tower, but the witch tricked him. She let the cut hair down. When he climbed up, he found the witch instead of Rapunzel! The prince was so upset he jumped from the tower and hurt his eyes. He could not see.

For many years, the prince wandered the forest. One day, he heard Rapunzel’s voice. He followed it and found her! Rapunzel was so happy, she cried. Her tears fell on his eyes, and he could see again.

The prince and Rapunzel went back to his kingdom. They were married and lived happily ever after.
