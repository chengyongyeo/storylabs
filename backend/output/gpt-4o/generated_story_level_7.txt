Rapunzel

Long ago, a man and a woman wished for a child. Behind their house was a beautiful garden filled with flowers and herbs. The garden belonged to a powerful enchantress, and no one dared to enter.

One day, the woman saw a patch of rampion, also called rapunzel, growing in the garden. She craved it so much that she grew pale and weak. “If I cannot have some rampion,” she said to her husband, “I may die.”

The man, desperate to save his wife, climbed over the high wall into the forbidden garden. He quickly picked some rampion and brought it back to her. She made a salad and ate it. It tasted so delicious that she wanted more.

The next evening, the man returned to the garden, but this time, the enchantress caught him. “How dare you steal from my garden!” she said. “You will pay for this.”

“Please,” the man begged, “I only did it because my wife needed the rampion so badly.”

The enchantress thought for a moment. “I will let you go,” she said, “but you must promise me something. When your wife’s child is born, you must give the baby to me. I will care for it as if it were my own.”

Frightened, the man agreed. When the baby girl was born, the enchantress took her and named her Rapunzel.

Rapunzel grew into the most beautiful child anyone had ever seen. But when she turned twelve, the enchantress locked her in a tower deep in the forest. The tower had no doors or stairs, only a single window at the top.

Whenever the enchantress wanted to visit, she stood below and called:

“Rapunzel, Rapunzel,
Let down your hair to me.”

Rapunzel’s golden hair was so long that it reached the ground. She tied her hair to a hook near the window and let it fall. The enchantress climbed up the braid like a rope.

One day, a prince was riding through the forest and heard Rapunzel singing. Her voice was so lovely that he stopped to listen. He searched for a way into the tower but found none. Hidden behind the trees, he saw the enchantress arrive and call out:

“Rapunzel, Rapunzel,
Let down your hair to me.”

The prince watched as the golden braid fell, and the enchantress climbed up. The next evening, the prince returned. He stood below the tower and called:

“Rapunzel, Rapunzel,
Let down your hair to me.”

To his delight, the braid fell, and he climbed up. When Rapunzel saw him, she was frightened, for she had never seen a man before. But the prince spoke kindly, and soon Rapunzel trusted him. He asked her to marry him, and she said yes.

They planned to escape together. Each time the prince visited, he brought a skein of silk. Rapunzel began to weave the silk into a ladder.

But one day, Rapunzel accidentally told the enchantress about the prince. “Dame Gothel,” she said, “why are you so much heavier than the prince? He climbs up so quickly!”

The enchantress was furious. “You have betrayed me!” she cried. She grabbed Rapunzel’s hair and cut it off. Then, she banished Rapunzel to a desert far away.

That evening, the enchantress waited in the tower. When the prince climbed up, he found her instead of Rapunzel. “You will never see Rapunzel again!” she hissed. The prince was so heartbroken that he jumped from the tower. He survived, but the fall blinded him.

For years, the prince wandered the forest, living on roots and berries. One day, he heard a familiar voice. He followed it and found Rapunzel. Overjoyed, she ran to him and wept. Her tears fell on his eyes, and miraculously, his sight was restored.

The prince took Rapunzel and their two children, a boy and a girl, to his kingdom. They were welcomed with joy and lived happily ever after.
