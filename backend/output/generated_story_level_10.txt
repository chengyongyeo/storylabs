# Rapunzel

## By [Your Name]

Once upon a time, there was a man and a woman who wanted a child very badly. They wished for a long time, and finally, the woman thought that her wish might come true. 

In their house, there was a small window that looked out onto a beautiful garden. This garden was full of colorful flowers and tasty herbs. However, there was a high wall around it, and no one dared to go inside because it belonged to a powerful enchantress. She was feared by all who lived nearby. 

One day, the woman was looking down into the garden when she saw a plant called rampion, also known as rapunzel. It looked so fresh and green that she craved it with all her heart. She began to look pale and weak. Her husband saw her distress and asked, “What’s wrong, my dear wife?” 

She replied, “If I can’t have some of that rampion from the garden, I might die!” 

The husband loved his wife and decided to help her. He thought, “I will do anything to save her.” When evening came, he climbed over the wall into the enchanted garden and quickly gathered some rampion for her. She made a salad, and it tasted so good that the next day, she craved it even more. 

The husband knew he had to go again. He climbed down into the garden once more, but this time, the enchantress saw him. “How dare you steal from my garden!” she exclaimed angrily. “You will pay for this!”

The husband was terrified but explained, “Please, have mercy! My wife wanted the rampion so badly that she would have died without it!” 

The enchantress felt a little sorry for him and said, “If you want the rampion, you can take some. But I want the child your wife will have. I will care for it as a mother.” 

In his fear, the husband agreed. When the baby was born, the enchantress took the child and named her Rapunzel. 

Rapunzel grew into a beautiful girl. When she was twelve, the enchantress shut her away in a tower deep in a forest. The tower had no stairs or doors—only a small window at the very top. 

Whenever the enchantress wanted to enter the tower, she called out:

“Rapunzel, Rapunzel,  
Let down your hair to me.”

Rapunzel had long, golden hair. When she heard her voice, she let her hair fall down from the window. The enchantress climbed up to see her.

One day, a prince rode through the forest and heard Rapunzel singing. Her voice was so lovely that he stopped to listen. He wanted to see her, but he couldn't find a way into the tower. Every day, he returned to hear her song. 

One evening, while hiding behind a tree, he saw the enchantress approach the tower. He heard her call:

“Rapunzel, Rapunzel,  
Let down your hair to me.”

Rapunzel let down her hair, and the enchantress climbed up. The prince thought, “If that is how she gets in, I can do the same!” 

The next evening, he went to the tower and called out:

“Rapunzel, Rapunzel,  
Let down your hair to me.”

Rapunzel let down her hair, and the prince climbed up. 

At first, Rapunzel was frightened by this handsome stranger, but the prince spoke gently. He told her how he had been enchanted by her beautiful voice and couldn’t bear to be apart from her. As they talked, Rapunzel began to feel safe. 

When he asked her to marry him, she thought, “He will love me more than the enchantress does.” She said yes! 

Rapunzel wanted to escape the tower. She asked the prince to bring a skein of silk every time he visited. She would weave a ladder, and when it was ready, they would leave together on his horse. 

The prince agreed to visit her every evening. The enchantress didn’t notice anything until one day, Rapunzel asked, “Why do you feel so heavy when I pull you up compared to the prince?” 

The enchantress was furious. “You deceitful girl! I thought I had hidden you away!” 

In her rage, she cut off Rapunzel’s beautiful hair and banished her to a deserted place. 

When the prince came again and called for Rapunzel, the enchantress let down the hair but mocked him. “You will never see her again! Rapunzel is lost!” 

Overcome with sorrow, the prince jumped from the tower. His fall left him blind, and he wandered through the forest, heartbroken and lost. 

One day, he stumbled upon the desert where Rapunzel had been living alone with her twin children, a boy and a girl. Hearing a familiar voice, he followed it. When Rapunzel recognized him, she rushed to him and wept. 

Her tears fell into his eyes, and suddenly he could see again. They hugged tightly, rejoicing at their reunion. 

The prince took Rapunzel and their children back to his kingdom. They were welcomed with joy and lived happily ever after. Together, they created a family filled with love and laughter, never forgetting the struggles they faced.
