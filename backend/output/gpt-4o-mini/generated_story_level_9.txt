**Rapunzel**

Once, there was a man and woman who wanted a baby. They waited a long time for their wish to come true. One day, the woman looked out her window and saw a beautiful garden filled with flowers and herbs. This garden belonged to a powerful enchantress, and no one dared to enter it.

The woman saw a plant called rampion, which looked delicious. She wanted it so much that she began to feel weak. Her husband noticed and asked, “What’s wrong, dear wife?” She replied, “If I can’t eat some of the rampion from the garden, I will be very ill!”

Loving her, the husband decided to get the rampion. That evening, he climbed over the wall into the garden. He grabbed some rampion and brought it home. His wife ate it happily, but the next day, she wanted more! The husband realized he had to go back into the garden.

Again, he climbed over the wall, but this time, the enchantress caught him. “How dare you steal my rampion?” she demanded. The husband explained, “My wife was so ill from wanting it. Please have mercy!”

The enchantress, feeling a bit kind, said, “I will let you take the rampion, but you must give me the baby your wife will have.” Terrified, the husband agreed. When the baby was born, the enchantress took her and named her Rapunzel.

Rapunzel grew up to be very beautiful. When she turned twelve, the enchantress locked her in a tower deep in the forest. The tower had no door, only a small window at the top. When the enchantress wanted to visit Rapunzel, she called up to her.

“Rapunzel, Rapunzel, let down your hair for me.”

Rapunzel had long, golden hair. She let it down, and the enchantress climbed up.

One day, a prince rode through the forest and heard Rapunzel singing. He was enchanted by her voice and wanted to meet her. But there was no door! Each day, he returned to listen.

Then, he saw the enchantress call to Rapunzel. Inspired, he shouted, “Rapunzel, Rapunzel, let down your hair for me!” Rapunzel let down her hair, and the prince climbed up.

At first, Rapunzel was scared, but the prince spoke kindly. He told her how her song moved him. Soon, they became friends. The prince asked her to marry him. Rapunzel agreed, thinking he would love her much more than the enchantress ever did.

“Bring me silk every time you come,” she said. “I will weave a ladder, and when it is ready, we can escape together.” They planned to meet every evening since the enchantress came during the day.

But then, the enchantress discovered the truth. Furious, she cut off Rapunzel’s hair and took her to a lonely desert, far away.

The next day, when the prince called for Rapunzel, the enchantress let down the hair—but it wasn’t Rapunzel. When the prince climbed up, he found the enchantress instead. “You will never see Rapunzel again!” she laughed wickedly.

Heartbroken, the prince jumped from the tower in despair. He landed in thorns that blinded him. For years, he wandered the forest, sad and alone, thinking of Rapunzel.

One day, he heard a familiar voice. It was Rapunzel! She had given birth to a boy and a girl in her lonely life. When they reunited, Rapunzel’s tears fell upon his eyes and healed him. He could see again!

The prince took Rapunzel and their kids to his kingdom. They lived happily ever after, thankful for their love and family.
