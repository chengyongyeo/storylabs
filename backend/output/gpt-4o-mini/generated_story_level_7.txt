## Rapunzel

Once upon a time, a man and a woman wished for a baby. They waited long, and one day the woman thought she would finally have a child. They lived in a house with a little window that looked out onto a beautiful garden. This garden was full of flowers and herbs, but it was surrounded by a high wall. No one dared to go in because it belonged to a powerful enchantress that everyone feared.

One day, the woman looked out the window and saw a plant with lovely green leaves called rampion (or rapunzel). It looked so fresh that she wanted to eat it. She longed for it so much that she became pale and sad. Her husband noticed and asked, “What’s wrong, my dear?” She replied, “If I can’t eat some of that rampion from the garden, I think I will die!”

The husband loved her very much and decided he must help her. That evening, he climbed over the wall into the garden of the enchantress. He quickly picked some rampion and took it to his wife. When she ate it, she felt so happy! But soon, she wanted more and more.

The next night, the husband climbed back over the wall again, but this time he was caught by the enchantress. “How dare you steal my rampion?” she shouted angrily. “You will pay for this!” The man was scared but told her the truth. He said, “Please, I did this for my wife. She was so sick with craving for it!”

The enchantress listened and softened her anger. She said, “If you promise to give me the child your wife will have, I will let you take as much rampion as you want. I will care for the child as if it were my own.” The man, filled with fear, agreed. When the baby was born, the enchantress took her and named her Rapunzel.

Rapunzel grew up to be the most beautiful girl. When she turned twelve, the enchantress locked her in a tall tower in the forest. There were no stairs or doors, only a small window at the top. Whenever the enchantress wanted to visit Rapunzel, she would stand below and call:

“Rapunzel, Rapunzel,  
Let down your hair to me.”

Rapunzel had long, gorgeous hair like spun gold. When she heard the enchantress’s voice, she would let her hair down from the window, and the enchantress would climb up.

One day, a young prince rode through the forest and heard Rapunzel singing. He was enchanted by her lovely voice and wanted to see her. He searched for a door to the tower but found none. Every day after that, he would return to listen to her beautiful songs.

One evening, while hiding behind a tree, the prince saw the enchantress come to the tower. He heard her call for Rapunzel. That’s when he thought, “If that’s how to reach her, I will try it too!” 

The next night, he called:

“Rapunzel, Rapunzel,  
Let down your hair to me.”

Rapunzel let her hair down, and the prince climbed up. At first, she was frightened because she had never met a man before. But the prince spoke gently to her. He explained that her beautiful voice had touched his heart and he had to meet her. 

Rapunzel felt safe and happy, and when the prince asked her to be his wife, she agreed. “I will go with you,” she said. “But I need to make a way to climb down. Bring me a skein of silk each time you come. I will weave it into a ladder.”

The prince promised to visit her every evening, but the enchantress came during the day. One day, the enchantress noticed something strange. “Rapunzel,” she asked, “why is it so much easier for the prince to climb than me?” 

Rapunzel replied, “Oh, it’s just that he is lighter!” The enchantress became furious. “Wicked child!” she shouted. “You have deceived me!” In her rage, she cut off Rapunzel’s beautiful hair and took her far away to a lonely place.

That evening, when the prince came and called:

“Rapunzel, Rapunzel,  
Let down your hair to me,”

the enchantress let the chopped hair fall down. The prince climbed up, but was shocked to find the enchantress waiting for him. “Your beloved Rapunzel is gone,” she said with a sneer. “You will never see her again!”

Devastated, the prince leapt from the tower. The thorns below pierced his eyes, and he wandered blind in the forest for many years. He ate only roots and berries, crying for his lost Rapunzel. 

One day, while wandering in despair, he heard a voice that sounded so familiar. It was Rapunzel! She had been living in misery and had given birth to twins, a boy and a girl. When she recognized him, she rushed to him, and her tears fell on his eyes. Miraculously, his sight returned!

Together, they returned to the prince's kingdom, where they were welcomed with joy. They lived happily together for many years, their hearts forever bound by love.
