### Rapunzel

Once upon a time, there was a man and a woman. They wanted a baby, but they had no luck. One day, the woman saw a beautiful garden through their window. It was full of flowers and herbs. But the garden belonged to a powerful enchantress, and no one dared to go inside.

The woman saw some lovely rampion (which is a type of plant) and wanted to eat it. She wanted it so much that she began to feel very sick. Her husband worried and asked her, “What is wrong, dear wife?” 

“If I can't eat some of the rampion from that garden, I will die!” she said.

Her husband loved her, so he decided to help. At night, he climbed over the high wall and snatched some rampion for her. The woman was very happy and made a salad from it. It was so tasty that the next day, she wanted more.

Her husband had to go back to the garden again. This time, the enchantress caught him. “How dare you steal my rampion?” she scolded.

“Please, don’t be angry!” he begged. “My wife is very sick, and she needs the rampion to feel better.”

The enchantress felt a bit sorry for him. “You may take as much rampion as you want,” she said, “but you must promise me your child when it is born.”

Terrified, the man agreed. Soon after, a baby girl was born, and the enchantress came to take her. She named the girl Rapunzel.

Rapunzel grew into a beautiful girl. When she turned twelve, the enchantress locked her in a tall tower in the forest. The tower had no stairs or door, just a small window at the top.

When the enchantress wanted to visit, she would call out, "Rapunzel, Rapunzel, let down your hair to me." Rapunzel had long, golden hair. She would let it hang down for the enchantress to climb up.

One day, a prince rode by the tower and heard Rapunzel singing. He was enchanted by her beautiful voice. The prince wanted to meet her but couldn’t find a door.

Days passed, and he returned to the tower again. This time, he saw the enchantress come and call out to Rapunzel. “If that is how to climb, I will try too!” the prince said.

That night, he called, “Rapunzel, Rapunzel, let down your hair to me.” The hair fell down, and he climbed up.

Rapunzel was scared at first, but the prince spoke kindly to her. He told her how he had been touched by her song. Soon, she felt safe and agreed to be his wife.

To escape, they planned for the prince to bring silk every time he visited. Rapunzel would use it to weave a ladder.

One day, the enchantress noticed something was wrong when Rapunzel said, “Why is it easier to pull up the prince than you?” 

In her anger, the enchantress cut off Rapunzel's hair. She took her far away to live in sadness. 

When the prince came back, he found only the enchantress. “Your beautiful Rapunzel is gone!” she laughed. Heartbroken, the prince jumped from the tower and fell into thorns, which made him blind.

He wandered the forest, sad and hungry, until one day he heard a voice singing. It was Rapunzel! He followed the sound and found her. 

When she saw him, she cried tears of joy, and two tears fell on his eyes. Suddenly, he could see again! 

The prince took Rapunzel back to his kingdom, where they were welcomed with joy. They lived happily together with their children, a boy and a girl, for many years.
