## RAPUNZEL  

Once upon a time, there was a man and a woman. They wanted a baby more than anything. One day, the woman saw a beautiful garden from her window. The garden was full of lovely flowers and herbs. But the garden belonged to a powerful enchantress. No one dared to go inside.  

The woman looked at a special plant called rampion. She wanted to eat some so much that she became very sick. Her husband saw her and asked, "What is wrong?"  

"I must have some rampion from that garden, or I will die!" she said.  

The husband loved her very much. He thought, "I must get her some rampion!" That night, he climbed over the wall and into the garden. He quickly picked some rampion and took it to his wife. She made a salad and ate it all up. It tasted so good that she wanted more the next day.  

Her husband had to go back into the garden. But this time, he was very scared. When he climbed down the wall, the enchantress was there!  

"How dare you steal my rampion?" she shouted.  

“Please be kind,” said the man. “My wife saw your rampion and needs it to be healthy.”  

The enchantress listened and said, “I will let you take as much rampion as you want, but you must give me the child your wife will have.”  

The man was scared, but he agreed. Later, the enchantress took their baby girl and named her Rapunzel.  

Rapunzel grew up to be the most beautiful girl in the world. When she was twelve, the enchantress locked her in a tall tower in a forest. The tower had no stairs or door, only a small window.  

When the enchantress wanted to visit, she stood below and called,  
“Rapunzel, Rapunzel, 
let down your hair to me.”  

Rapunzel had long, golden hair. She let her hair down for the enchantress to climb up.  

One day, a prince rode through the forest. He heard Rapunzel singing and stopped to listen. He wanted to see her, but there was no door. He rode home but couldn’t stop thinking about her.  

Every day, he returned to listen to her beautiful voice. One night, he saw the enchantress come to the tower. She called,  
“Rapunzel, Rapunzel, 
let down your hair to me.”  

Rapunzel let down her hair, and the enchantress climbed up.  

The next evening, the prince stood by the tower and called,  
“Rapunzel, Rapunzel, 
let down your hair to me.”  

Rapunzel let her hair down, and the prince climbed up.  

At first, Rapunzel was scared of him. But he spoke to her kindly. “I have loved your voice and wanted to meet you,” he said. Rapunzel smiled and felt safe.  

“Will you be my wife?” he asked. She thought he was handsome and kind. “Yes!” she said.  

“But how will we escape?” she asked. “Bring me silk each time you visit. I will make a ladder with it.” They agreed to meet every evening, while the enchantress came during the day.  

But one day, the enchantress found out. “You have deceived me!” she shouted. In her anger, she cut off Rapunzel’s hair and took her to a lonely place.  

When the prince came to the tower that day and called for Rapunzel, the enchantress let down the hair. He climbed up, but instead of his love, he found the enchantress.  

“Your dear Rapunzel is gone!” she sneered. The prince was heartbroken. He jumped from the tower and fell into thorns, which blinded him.  

He wandered the forest alone, sad and lost. After many years, he found Rapunzel living in the desert. She had given birth to twins, a boy and a girl.  

“Rapunzel!” he called. She recognized his voice and they embraced, crying tears of joy. Two of her tears fell on his eyes, and he could see again!  

They returned to his kingdom, where everyone welcomed them with happiness. Tragically sad moments turned to joy, and they lived happily ever after.
