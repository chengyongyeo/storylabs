## Rapunzel

Once upon a time, there was a man and a woman who really wanted a baby. They hoped and hoped for a long time. One day, the woman looked out of their little window and saw a beautiful garden filled with colorful flowers and tasty herbs. This garden belonged to a powerful enchantress, and no one dared to go inside.

The woman saw a plant called rampion in the garden. It looked so fresh and green that she wanted to eat it very badly. She began to feel weak and sad. Her husband noticed and asked, “What is wrong, dear wife?” She replied, “If I can’t eat some rampion from that garden, I think I will die!”

The husband loved his wife very much. He decided he would go into the garden and get some rampion for her. That evening, he climbed over the wall and quickly picked some rampion. When he brought it home, his wife made a delicious salad and ate it all up. It tasted so good that the next day, she wanted more, even more than before!

The husband knew he had to go back. So, once again, he climbed over the wall, but this time he was very scared. The enchantress was waiting for him! “How dare you come into my garden and steal my rampion?” she shouted. “You will pay for this!”

The man was scared but told her, “Please, I did not mean to steal. My wife saw your rampion and wanted it so much she felt like she might die.” The enchantress listened and said, “If that is true, I will let you take as much rampion as you want—but there is one condition: you must give me the child your wife will have. I will take care of the child.”

The husband was afraid, but he agreed. When the woman had a baby, the enchantress came and took the child. She named her Rapunzel and raised her in a tall tower deep in the forest.

Rapunzel grew into a beautiful girl with long, golden hair. When she turned twelve, the enchantress locked her in the tower. There were no stairs or doors, just a small window at the top. To visit, the enchantress would stand below and call out:

“Rapunzel, Rapunzel,
Let down your hair to me.”

Every time the enchantress came, Rapunzel let her long hair down, and the enchantress climbed up.

One day, a young prince was riding through the forest when he heard a beautiful song. It was Rapunzel singing! He was so enchanted by her voice that he decided to find a way to see her. But he could not find a door to the tower.

Every day, he returned to hear her sweet voice. One day, he saw the enchantress come to the tower, and he heard her call:

“Rapunzel, Rapunzel,
Let down your hair to me.”

When he saw how Rapunzel let down her hair, he thought, “I will try this too!” That evening, he called up to her:

“Rapunzel, Rapunzel,
Let down your hair to me.”

Rapunzel was frightened at first when a man appeared, but the prince spoke kindly. He told her how beautiful her singing was and how much he wanted to meet her. Soon she was not afraid anymore, and they talked and laughed like friends.

The prince asked, “Will you marry me?” Rapunzel thought, “He is young and handsome. He will love me more than the enchantress.” She agreed. “I want to go with you, but I don’t know how,” she said. “Bring me some silk each time you come, and I will weave a ladder to escape.”

They agreed to meet each night because the enchantress came during the day. But one day, when Rapunzel asked the enchantress why she felt heavier to pull up than the prince, the enchantress became furious. She shouted, “You foolish girl! I thought I had separated you from the world! You will regret this!”

In her anger, the enchantress cut off Rapunzel’s long hair and took her far away to a lonely place. When the prince came and called for Rapunzel, the enchantress let her hair down but was waiting for him at the top.

“Ah! You thought you would find your lovely Rapunzel, but she is gone!” she mocked. The prince was heartbroken. In his despair, he jumped from the tower and fell into thorn bushes, which blinded him.

After wandering the forest for years and feeling sad, he finally came to a desert where Rapunzel lived with their twin children, a boy and a girl. He heard her beautiful voice and followed it. When he found her, Rapunzel recognized him and ran into his arms, crying tears of joy. Two of her tears fell on his eyes, and suddenly he could see again!

The prince took Rapunzel and their children back to his kingdom. They were joyfully welcomed and lived happily together for many years.
