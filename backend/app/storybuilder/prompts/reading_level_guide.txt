## Reading Level Guide

### Level 1
- **Description**: Level 1 books are for children who are just beginning to learn about books and reading. At this stage, your child is likely to be learning the alphabet at nursery, and may be able to recognise some simple, common words. Some books are wordless, with pictures telling the story. Wordless books provide lots to talk about, and help your child learn how to hold a book and turn the pages.
- **Approximate age**: 3–4 years old

### Level 1+
- **Description**: Level 1+ books are for children who are just beginning to use simple phonics to read words like ‘sat’ and ’pin’. The books use words that are familiar and predictable, and the pictures help convey the meaning of the story.
- **Approximate age**: 4–5 years old
- **Example**: Taken from *A Dragon Balloon*:
  - "Can Ben grab it? It is fun!"
  - "Get it in the net!"

### Level 2
- **Description**: By this stage, your child will be able to use their knowledge of letters and sounds to work out new words, though they may still need help. Pictures are used to help convey story meaning, and sentences are still mostly short and straightforward. Stories become very slightly more complex as your child becomes more comfortable reading more words.
- **Approximate age**: 4–5 years old
- **Example**: Taken from *Jack*:
  - "It ran at Dad. Quick! Pick him up!"
  - "Dad shut it in a pen."
- Number of words: 50

### Level 3
- **Description**: At this level, your child will be using phonics to help them read slightly more complicated words, including words with common digraphs like ‘ee’, ‘oa’, ‘ch’, and ‘th’. They will use phonics knowledge to work out less familiar words.
- **Approximate age**: 4–5 years old
- **Example**: Taken from *The Right Home*:
  - "I need a home that is right for me."
  - "My home needs to be fun. Let me see."

### Level 4
- **Description**: By Level 4, your child will be using their phonics knowledge to work out words quickly, and will know a range of common tricky words (like ‘said’, ‘some’, and ‘what’) by sight. They are likely to be more confident in giving their opinion about stories and non-fiction texts.
- **Approximate age**: 4–6 years old
- **Example**: Taken from *The Stinky Plant*:
  - "A man was sitting on a tree trunk. He did not look happy."
  - "“What is the matter?” said Wilma."

### Level 5
- **Description**: By Level 5, your child will start learning alternative spellings for the sounds in words – for example, they will learn that the letters ‘ou’ can be pronounced like ‘ow’ or ‘oo’. Level 5 books may contain words with apostrophes, such as ‘didn’t’ and ‘wasn’t’. They will also introduce children to unusual words that extend their vocabulary, like ‘terrible’ instead of ‘bad’.
- **Approximate age**: 5–6 years old
- **Example**: Taken from *The Parachute*:
  - "Nok told Ant and Tiger what to do. They tied the string to the plastic bag."
  - "“Can I go first?” asked Tiger. Nok put the parachute on Tiger’s back. Ant took a photo. “Smile!” he said."

### Level 6
- **Description**: Stories in Level 6 are longer and more complex than in previous levels. By Level 6, your child will often notice when their reading does not make sense, and they will go back to correct themselves without being asked to. They will be able to work out many words automatically without sounding them out. They will be working on more alternative spellings for different sounds – for example, they may know that the ‘igh’ sound can also be spelled ‘ie’, ‘y, or ‘i’.
- **Approximate age**: 5–6 years old
- **Example**: Taken from *Who Eats Who*:
  - "All living things are part of food chains. Yes, all living things – big and small, plants and animals!"
  - "A food chain is made when one living thing eats another living thing ... and that living thing eats another ... and that living thing eats another."

### Level 7
- **Description**: At Level 7, most children can read out loud quite fluently and can usually find the answer to a question within a section of text. Your child will get used to words with unusual phonics patterns, such as ‘beautiful’, ‘eye’, and ‘any’. Words with several syllables will often be included.
- **Approximate age**: 5–6 years old
- **Example**: Taken from *Planet Exis*:
  - "Max looked out through the micro-ship’s viewscreen. Ahead was a beautiful green planet with two glowing rings criss-crossing round it."
  - "“There it is at last, Nok,” Max said. “Planet Exis,” said Seven, who was hovering nearby. Nok’s eyes were shining. “Home,” he said."

### Level 8
- **Description**: At Level 8, children are generally more confident in their reading and know most common, non-decodable tricky words. Level 8 stories are often split into chapters. Your child is likely to enjoy choosing which books to read, often reading some of the text in order to help them decide.
- **Approximate age**: 6–7 years old
- **Example**: Taken from *Mini Marvels*:
  - "This amazing pygmy (say pig-mee) seahorse is found on coral reefs in warm, tropical seas. It looks like the coral, which helps it hide from predators."
  - "Many pairs of pygmy seahorses live on one piece of coral. The female seahorse lays eggs. Then the male carries the eggs in a pouch to look after them."

### Level 9
- **Description**: Once your child is at Level 9, they will be able to read most words automatically, either silently or out loud. With non-fiction texts, they will be able to use features like indexes, headings, and photo captions to find information.
- **Approximate age**: 6–8 years old
- **Example**: Taken from *False Alarms*:
  - "“Keep it,” said the Head. “No real harm was done. I’ve arranged for the door of the bank to be fixed.” He smiled. “When the bank manager saw your costumes, he thought you’d come from a rival circus!”"
  - "Boost and Flex raced to the skyscraper. High above, someone was standing on a platform, holding a bucket. “The thief!” cried Boost. “That bucket must be full of his stolen loot. Flex, get up there!”"

### Level 10
- **Description**: By Level 10, your child will be building up their stamina to read longer texts. They will use parts of unfamiliar words to help them work out the meaning (for example, spotting that ‘clarify’ is a bit like ‘clear’ so ‘clarify’ means ‘to make clear’).
- **Approximate age**: 6–8 years old
- **Example**: Taken from *A Life in the Sky*:
  - "Plunge Dive and Surface Dip"
  - "“I dive through air to dip in the waves. I’m quick and sharp and bold – I grab my fish!”"
  - "When they need food, Arctic terns fly across the water, then zoom down to grab fish or shrimp from the surface of the water. They sometimes eat insects as they fly."
